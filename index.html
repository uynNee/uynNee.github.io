    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Do Mai Uyen Nhi, a dedicated UI/UX Designer based in Ho Chi Minh City with a passion for creating intuitive, user-centered digital experiences. I have a strong foundation in UX design processes such as wireframing, prototyping, user research, and usability testing, and am proficient in tools like Figma. With experience in both front-end development and collaborative team environments, I strive to bridge the gap between user needs and visual design.
